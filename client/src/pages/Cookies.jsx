      <p>
        <strong>Last updated: November, 30th. 2023</strong>

      <p>
        This cookie policy explains how Guideline Gopher ("we", "us", or "our")
        uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit
        our website at guidelinegopher.com. It explains what these technologies
        are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of
        them.

      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
        efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Guideline Gopher) are
        called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the
        website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies
        enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or
        through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
        analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize
        your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
        it visits certain other websites.
      </p>

      <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some
        cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to
        operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
        cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
        of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties
        serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other
        purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>What types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential website cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly
          necessary to provide you with services available through our website
          and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics and customization cookies:</strong> These cookies
          collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us
          understand how our website is being used or how effective our
          marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to make
          advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like
          preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that
          ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements
          that are based on your interests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social networking cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to
          enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our
          website through third party social networking and other websites.
          These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
        Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
        which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
        cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
        services.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
        on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
        website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
        website may be restricted.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
        cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web
        browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
        browser's help menu for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>Do we update this policy?</h2>

      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
        example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal,
        or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this policy regularly
        to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
      </p>

      <h2>Where can you get further information?</h2>

        technologies, please email us at info@guidelinegopher.com.
